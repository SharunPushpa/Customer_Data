# Customer Data Analysis

This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using Python and Machine Learning techniques.

STEP 6: Final Deliverables

This step presents the final outputs of the Customer Purchase Prediction project. It summarizes the work completed, the visualizations generated, the performance of the machine learning models, and the insights gained from the analysis.

6.1 Clean and Documented Notebook

A well-organized and fully documented Jupyter Notebook was created for this project. The notebook contains clearly separated sections for each phase of the machine learning workflow, including:

* Data Loading and Understanding

* Data Preprocessing

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Model Building

* Model Evaluation

* Final Results and Insights

Each section includes well-commented Python code along with short explanations describing the purpose of each step. This ensures that the notebook is easy to read, understand, and reproduce. All unnecessary cells and errors were removed to maintain clarity and professionalism.

6.2 Visualizations

* Several meaningful visualizations were created during the Exploratory Data Analysis phase to understand customer behavior and data patterns. These include:

* Distribution plots of customer age, revenue, and number of purchases

* Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between different features

* Scatter plots to analyze how customer attributes influence purchasing behavior

These visualizations helped in identifying important trends and patterns. For example, customers with higher revenue and greater engagement showed a higher tendency to make purchases. Visual analysis played a key role in understanding the dataset before applying machine learning models.

6.3 Final Model Comparison Summary

* Multiple classification models were implemented and evaluated, including:

* Logistic Regression

* Decision Tree

* Random Forest

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model was evaluated using performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix. The results were compared to determine the best-performing model.

Among all the models tested, the best-performing model was selected based on the highest Accuracy and F1-Score. This model showed the best balance between correct predictions and error minimization and was chosen as the final model for customer purchase prediction.

6.4 Explanation of Project Insights

The project provided valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior. The Exploratory Data Analysis showed that factors such as customer revenue, engagement level, and previous purchase behavior have a strong influence on whether a customer will make a purchase.

The correlation analysis revealed that customers who spend more and interact more frequently with the platform are more likely to purchase products. The machine learning models were able to capture these patterns and make reliable predictions based on customer data.

The selected best-performing model successfully predicted whether a customer would make a purchase, demonstrating the effectiveness of classification algorithms in customer behavior analysis.

6.5 Final Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the complete machine learning pipeline, starting from data loading and preprocessing to model building and evaluation. The final model can be used by businesses to identify potential customers and improve marketing strategies by targeting users who are more likely to make a purchase.

Overall, the project achieved its objective of predicting customer purchase behavior and provided meaningful insights into customer data using machine learning techniques.
